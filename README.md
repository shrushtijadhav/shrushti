I am passionate Data enthuiast, trying to get in the field of Data. While working as a Software Developer, I realized my keen interest towards data and making this amazing visualizations of data.
Learning more and more new things daily and this process is overwhelming as well as productive. 
I want to feel each and every second of this process coz this is the process where I am growing bit by bit and it feels great.
I am very much intrigued to know more and I am going to keep learning coz that is keeping me active and sane.
